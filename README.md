# Sales-Data-Analytics
In this project, I analyzed 3 years worth of sales data on office appliances to answer the following questions:
- What is the trend of the overall sales?
- What are the top 10 products by sales?
- What products are the most sold?
- What ship mode is the most preferred?
- What categories (and sub-categories) are the most profitable?
